<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there — I'm abdo saleh, a  web developer, designer, photographer, writer with a love for turning ideas into reality.<br /> Whether it's crafting beautiful user experiences, building clean and functional code, or telling compelling stories, I bring creativity, curiosity, and precision to everything I do.<br />
  I’m driven by a mix of passion and purpose, always learning, always evolving. When I’m not working on projects, you’ll probably find me [something personal—reading, hiking, obsessing over coffee, etc.].<br />
  
  Let’s connect and create something great together.
